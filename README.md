Interact with the Confluence API and perform machine learning tasks in Go. 

Steps should be:

- HTTP Requests: Use the standard `net/http` package in Go to make HTTP requests to the Confluence API endpoints. You'll need to authenticate and handle pagination if you're retrieving multiple pages of content.

- JSON Parsing: Parse the JSON responses from the Confluence API using Go's built-in `encoding/json` package. Extract the relevant data from the JSON responses, such as page content and metadata.

- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data as needed for your machine learning task. This might involve cleaning the text, tokenizing it into words or sentences, removing stop words, and performing other text preprocessing tasks.

- Feature Extraction: Extract features from the text data to use as input for your machine learning model. This could include bag-of-words representations, TF-IDF vectors, word embeddings, or other types of features depending on your specific task.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Use existing libraries for machine learning algorithms and modeling in Go, such as `gorgonia` or `golearn`, to train and evaluate your machine learning model. These libraries provide tools for building neural networks, decision trees, and other types of models.

- Iterate and Refine: Experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature representations, and machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of your model. Continuously iterate and refine your approach based on feedback and performance metrics.

But let's see...
